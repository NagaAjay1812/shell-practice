# 🐚 Shell Scripting Practice & Examples

This repository contains hands-on **Bash shell scripting practice** designed to help you confidently write real scripts for Linux environments. Instead of just reading commands, here you’ll learn to think like an automation engineer who can solve real problems using shell scripts.

## 📍 Why Shell Scripting Matters

Every system admin, DevOps engineer, or backend developer eventually asks:

> *How do I automate repetitive tasks on Linux?*

Shell scripting is the core foundation of automation. Once you can read and write shell scripts, you can:

- Automate daily tasks
- Create reusable utilities
- Parse logs and files
- Build install scripts
- Handle deployment workflows

This repo is made to practice those skills.

## 📂 What’s Inside

This repo contains:

### 📁 Script Examples
- `hello.sh` — Simple greetings script
- `vars.sh` — Variables and parameter usage
- `conditions.sh` — `if`, `else`, `elif` usage
- `loops.sh` — `for`, `while`, `until` loops
- `functions.sh` — Reusable function examples
- `user_input.sh` — Interactive script reading user input
- `file_ops.sh` — File existence & operations
- `menu.sh` — Example menu-based script

Each script demonstrates a concept you’ll use in real automation.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

In this practice repo, you will learn:

✅ Variables and quoting  
✅ Conditionals (`if`, `case`)  
✅ Loops (`for`, `while`, `until`)  
✅ Functions and return values  
✅ Reading user input  
✅ Command exit codes  
✅ Using arguments (`$1`, `$2`)  
✅ File and directory checks  
✅ Debugging with `set -x`

These are the fundamental building blocks of any automation task.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NagaAjay1812/shell-practice
cd shell-practice
```

2. Make a script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x hello.sh

## 📌 Example: Conditions in Action

Here’s a sample snippet you’ll find in `conditions.sh`:

```bash
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
  echo "You are an adult."
else
  echo "You are underage."
fi
```

Simple syntax. Big impact.
